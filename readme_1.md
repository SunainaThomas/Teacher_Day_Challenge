This C++ function, find Numbers, takes a vector of integers and returns the count of numbers that contain an even number of digits.

The core logic iterates through each number in the provided vector, counts the number of digits for each, and increases a counter if the digit count is even. Digits are counted by successively dividing the number by 10 until it reaches zero.

How It Works
   For each number in the input vector:

-->The number of digits is counted by dividing it by 10 until it becomes 0.

-->If the count of digits is even, a counter is incremented.

-->The function returns the total count of numbers with an even number of digits.
